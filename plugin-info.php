**Watermark your precious images**, keeping track of them in the internet. New uploads can automatically be marked or you can **add/remove watermarks** via the Media Library. Unmarked copies of images are kept inaccessible to the public in case you want to restore it.

* Keep **original aspect ration** of uploaded images, preventing automatic cropping
* Specify a **suffix for resized images** to be added to names, eg upload of too large image `test.jpg` will be stored as `test_resized.jpg`
* Set **quality for resized images**, allowing to save further space and bandwidth
* Select image sizes to watermark, eg to excluding thumbnails
* **Mass-add/-remove watermarks** for already uploaded image attachments
* Select **location of watermark** on the image and maximum width/height to cover

> [!NOTE]
> **Only handles JPG / JPEG images**, as PNG (transparency) and GIF (animation) could loose their features upon resizing.!

For manually adding / removing of watermarks visit the Media Library, where you find this function as part of an images row actions, when hovering.';

This plugin additionally allows a **customized suffix for resized images**, compared to the unchangeable default `-scaled` suffix.

Technical answer: Other image formats can contain information and have special characteristics making their handling very tricky and error-prone. For example: `PNG` files can contain transparency levels, additionally they can be animated. Similar for `GIF` images.

Honest answer: To limit complexity of the plugin ;-)',
